This is the **<%- h.al(me) %>** and the hound and the horn  
That belonged to the <%- h.ll(p.farmer) %> sowing his corn  
That kept the <%- h.ll(p.cock) %> that crowed in the morn  
That woke the <%- h.ll(p.priest) %> all shaven and shorn  
That married the <%- h.ll(p.man) %> all tattered and torn  
That kissed the <%- h.ll(p.maiden) %> all forlorn  
That milked the <%- h.ll(p.cow) %> with the crumpled horn  
That tossed the <%- h.ll(p.dog) %> that worried the <%- h.ll(p.cat) %>  
That killed the <%- h.ll(p.rat) %> that ate the <%- h.ll(p.malt) %>  
That lay in the <%- h.ll(p.house) %> that Jack built. <%- m.up() %>
